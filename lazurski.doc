This file was posted in uuencoded form to USENET comp.fonts by:
 Wesley Dudzinski (wesley@rahul.net)
The only information I can give you on theses fonts is that they are in
 koi8 encoding (or mostly).

My only contribution is writing this file and upload it to the right location 
 (ftp::nic.funet.fi:/pub/culture/russian/Incoming) and mail it to rustex-l
 mailling list.

This file containt the folowing font.

LAZURSK1.FOT:	Lazurski Bold (TrueType)
LAZURSK2.FOT:	Lazurski Bold Italic (TrueType)

That's all. and not much !
